# umpire_rating_system
A model created to evaluate and rate each MLB umpire on their pitch calling accuracy by determining the percentage of pitches above or below average they miscall by zone (based on pitchFX gameday zones 1 through 14) and the difference vs. the league average of umpires.

Data used for this model can be retrieved from the following kaggle page: [MLB Pitch Data 2015-2018](https://www.kaggle.com/pschale/mlb-pitch-data-20152018), additionally the data should be available to scrape through the R [mlbgameday](https://github.com/keberwein/mlbgameday) package.
